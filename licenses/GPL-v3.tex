to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program 
to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

The GPL ensures that you have the freedom to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Run the program for any purpose;
\item Study how the program works and change it;
\item Redistribute copies;
\item Distribute modified versions.
\end{itemize}
